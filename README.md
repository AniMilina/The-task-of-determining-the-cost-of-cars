# The-task-of-determining-the-cost-of-cars  

Customer: service for the sale of used cars "Not broken, not painted"
Input data

Technical characteristics, configurations and prices of used cars
Target

Create a model to determine the market value of a used car using historical data
Target Metric: RMSE

Tasks

Conduct exploratory data analysis

Correct data errors

Explore options for creating new features

Assess the expected impact of the original and new features on the quality of the model

Prepare data for model training

Create several model variants

Evaluate model training time, as well as prediction time and quality

Calculate additional model metrics

Select the best model and conduct an in-depth study

Our task is to develop and implement code in Python that will create a model for calculating the cost of cars based on the data provided

To develop a model, we can use techniques such as data preprocessing, creating new features, feature engineering, selecting suitable machine learning algorithms, adjusting hyperparameters, and selecting quality metrics. In addition, it is necessary to evaluate the quality and training time of models in order to choose the most optimal option.

As a result of working on the problem, we will receive a model that will be able to predict the cost of cars based on technical characteristics, configurations and other parameters, such as the age of the car and its mileage. This may be useful for a used car sales service to understand which cars may be of interest to buyers and at what
